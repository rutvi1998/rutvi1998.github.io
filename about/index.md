    Hey, I am Rutvi! 
    
    I am a first-year student, pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore. I am familiar with the programming languages Java, C++, Python and C. I am relatively new to the world of open-source development but I am entusiastic about it all the same.
    
    I'd say I am a chatty and cheerful girl. My hobbies include poetry, dancing, reading, sketching and travelling. I dream big becuause "it is precisely the possibility of realizing a dream that makes life interesting." Just quoted Paulo Coelho there.
    
    Guess that's all I had to say. 
    
    
    Oh oh oh oh oh, I love candies!
