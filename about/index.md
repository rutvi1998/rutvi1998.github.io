### Hey, I am Rutvi!
  
I'm a first-year student, pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at International 
Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore. I am familiar with the programming languages 
Java, C++, Python and C. I am relatively new to the world of open-source development but I'm 
enthusiastic about it all the same.

I'd say I am a chatty and cheerful girl. My hobbies include poetry, dancing, reading, 
sketching and travelling! 




I believe in dreaming big because like Paulo Coelho said, *it is precisely the possibility of 
realizing a dream that makes life interesting.*
